(Most of this exercise is a review exercise on some of the notions we have encountered before.)

1. (25 points) Suppose that there exists an efficient algorithm $A$ that on input $m$ and $a \in \Z^*_m$ outputs the smallest number $r$ such that $a^r = 1 (\mod m)$. Prove that under this assumption there is an efficient (probabilistic) algorithm $B$ that on input $m=pq$ with $q (\mod 4) = p (\mod 4)=3$, outputs $p$ and $q$. You can follow the outline of the lecture notes, or see the footnote for hint on another approach[^hint]
  
  We present the proof in two forms. First following the details from lecture. 
  We define the efficient, probabilistic algorithm $B$ to do the following. On input $m = pq$, it selects
  a random $g \in \Z_m^*$. It then passes this $g$ as input into $A$ such that $r = A(g)$ where $r = order(g)$. 
  From this result, $B$ then calculates the values $s = m + 1 - r$ and solves the polynomial
  ~Math
   x^2 - s + m = 0 \pmod m
  ~
  for $x$. It then outputs the values $x, m /x$. The claim is that $x$ and $m/x$ are the factors $p,q$ of
  $m$ with high probability. The first step in proving this claim is demonstrating that with high
  probability, the element $g$ that is chose at random from $\Z_m^*$ is a generator of $\Z_m^*$ and 
  therefore we have that $r = order(g) = |Z_m^*|$.
  ~ Proof
    The proof is relatively straight forward. The element $g$ is chosen uniformly at random. We know from
    the definition of $|Z_m^*|$ that for all $a \in Z_m^*$, $a^{|Z_m^*|} = 1 \pmod m$. Therefore, the
    order of $a$ must be a divisor of $|Z_m^*|$. Note that $|Z_m^*|$ has at most $\log |Z_m^*|$ divisors,
    and as such, the probability that $order(a) = d$ where $d \mid |Z_m^*|$ and $d \neq Z_m^*|$ is at least
    $1 - \frac{\log |Z_m^*| }{|Z_m^*|}$ (as an upper bound on the number of factors, suppose all factors
    are $2$, then there are at most $\log |Z_m^*|$ such factors). Therefore, we have that with a 
    high likelihood, the random element
    $g$ that we have selected is a generator of the group $Z_m^*$. If we wish to increase the likelihood
    of this occurring, we can simply select multiple $g_i$ at random from $Z_m^*$ and take their 
    least common multiple. Note that all $g_i$ are divisors of $|Z_m^*|$ and therefore, the likelihood
    only increases if we take their LCM.  However, as we can see from the above, this is not strictly
    necessary since for large $m$, the likelihood that $g$ selected at random is a generator of $|Z_m|$
    is at least $1 - negl$ since $\log x << x$ for large $x$.  
  ~
  
  Now we present the proof as outlined in the footnotes. First: With non-negligible probability, if we pick
  a random $a \in \Z^*_m$ then $a$ will have even order and $a^{r/2} \neq -1 \pmod{m}$.
  ~Lemma
    
  ~
  ~Proof
   Suppose such an adversary exists. 
  ~
[^hint]: For starters, you can  assume for partial credit the following claim: with probability at least $1/100$, if we pick a random $a\in \Z^*_m$ then $a$ will have an even order and $a^{r/2} \neq -1 (\mod m)$. Using the claim you can reduce factoring to order finding in a similar way to how we reduced factoring to finding square roots. For full credit, prove the claim by first proving using the chinese remainder theorem that for every $a$, the order of $a$ modulo $m$ is the least common multiple of the order of $a$ modulo $P$ and the order of $a$ modulo $q$, and then use the fact that for every group $G$, if $G' \neq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $|G|/|G'| \geq 2$.  

2. (50 points) Consider the following proof system for Alice to prove to Bob that a graph is 3 colorable:
  * __Common input:__ Graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices.
  
  * __Alice (Prover) private input:__ A function $f:V\rightarrow \{1,2,3\}$ such that $f(i)\neq f(j)$ for every $\{i,j\}\in E$.
  
  * __Step 1: Alice <- Bob:__ Bob selects $z,z' \getsr \zo^{10n}$ and sends $z$ to Alice.
  * __Step 2: Alice -> Bob:__ Alice selects $\pi$ to be a random permutation over $\{1,2,3\}$ and defines the functions $f':V\rightarrow \{1,2,3\}$ as $f'(i)=\pi(f(i))$. For $i=1..n$, Alice chooses  $w_i \getsr \zo^n$ and sends to Bob $y_i = PRG(w_i)+f'(i)z +(f'(i) \mod\; 3)z' (\mod 2)$ where $PRG:\zo^n\rightarrow\zo^{10n}$ is a pseudorandom generator and vector addition and vector/scalar multiplication are defined as usual.
  * __Step 3: Bob <- Alice:__ Bob selects a random edge  $\{i,j \} \in E$ and sends $i$ and $j$ to Alice.
  * __Step 4: Alice -> Bob:__ Alice checks that $\{i,j\}\in E$ (otherwise she aborts) and if so sends the strings $w_i,w_j$ and the values $f'(i),f'(j)$.
  * __Bob's decision:__ Bob accepts the proof iff $f'(i),f'(j)$ as sent by Alice are two distinct numbers in $\{1,2,3\}$ and the strings she sent satisfy the equations $y_i = PRG(w_i)+f'(i)z +(f'(i) \mod\; 3)z' (\mod 2)$  and $y_j = PRG(w_j)+f'(j)z +(f'(j) \mod\; 3)z' (\mod 2)$

Prove that this system is a zero knowledge proof system for the 3 coloring problem by showing the following:

  a. (Completeness, 10 points): Prove that if Alice and Bob are given inputs as above and both follow the protocol then Bob will accept the proof with probability $1$.
  ~Proof
    TODO
  ~
  b. (Soundness, 15 points): Prove that if there exists no 3-coloring for $G$ (i.e., for every coloring of $G$'s vertices in $\{1,2,3\}$ there is some edge $\{i,j\}$ such that both $i$ and $j$ receive the same color), then with probability at least $1/(10n^2)$ Bob  will reject the proof. (This probability can be amplified to more than $1-2^{-k}$ by $100kn^2$ repetitions).
  ~Proof
   TODO 
  ~
  c. (Zero knowledge, 25 points) Prove that for every polynomial-time strategy $B^*$ used by Bob, there exists an efficient algorithm $S^*$, so that for every 3-colorable graph $G$ and coloring $f$, the output of $S^*(G)$ is computationally indistinguishabl from the transcript  $B^*$ observes after interacting with the honest strategy of Alice on public input $G$ and private input $x$. (For partial credit of 15 points, prove only _honest verifier zero knowledge_ : that the above holds when $B^*$ is the honest strategy of Bob.)
